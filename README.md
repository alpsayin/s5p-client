### Another Sentinel-5 Precursor data query and downloader tool

This tool is written to automate data download, conversion and aggregation for a daily NO2 levels visualisation project.

User guide is coming...

### Acknowledgements

I wrote this tool while working at Novit.AI for https://emissions.novit.ai project. I'm releasing the source under my management with Novit's permission. I would also like to acknowledge and thank the ESA (European Spatial Agency) for the access to the Sentinel 5P Hub.

### Alternative tool which uses the proper sentinelsat library but a bit more complex
For all realistic purposes you should probably use below tool
